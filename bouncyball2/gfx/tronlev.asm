* Graphics and blit test running at 256x192 16 color mode.
*
* Tabs set to 8 and using real tabs, not spaces.
*
* Revision 797 has coolspot animating.
* Revision 834 is an early level render working nicely
*
* Compile:
* lwasm -9 -b -o tronlev.bin tronlev.asm && writecocofile --verbose gfx.dsk tronlev.bin && coco3 `pwd`/gfx.dsk tronlev
* lwasm -l -9 -b -p cd -o tronlev.bin tronlev.asm > tronlev.lst && writecocofile --verbose gfx.dsk tronlev.bin && writecocofile --verbose ~/workspace/coco/edtasm6309/cc3/ed.dsk tronlev.bin && coco3 `pwd`/gfx.dsk tronlev
* ~/bin/mess64 -debug -window -waitvsync -resolution 1024x768 -natural -cfg_directory ~/coco -biospath ~/roms coco3 -flop1 `pwd`/gfx.dsk -autoboot_delay 1 -autoboot_command "LOADM\"tronlev\":EXEC\n"
*
* This is just a test to see how to set the video mode, and a hacky blit routine
* to display something.
