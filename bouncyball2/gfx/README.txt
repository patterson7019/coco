# Center Points #

Center points allow you to define the offset of where a sprite should be placed.

It allows the programmer to draw a sprite at a given location, and the artist defines the offset. This means that if the artist adjusted the image size, the programmer doesn't have to change any code.

In multiple frame animations, each frame can be a different size, saving space. With the center point, the programmer can always draw at a particular location, and the center point will ensure that the frame is drawn to the correct location.
